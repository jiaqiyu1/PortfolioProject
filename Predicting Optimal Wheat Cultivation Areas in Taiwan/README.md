This study utilizes ArcGIS and R to predict the most suitable areas for wheat cultivation in Taiwan, providing valuable insights for agricultural planning and decision-making in the region.

* Conducted requirement gathering to identify suitable planting areas for wheat.
* Sourced climate data from the internal data warehouse.
* Cleaned and processed climate data (temperature, humidity, light) using R.
* Analysed and reported on data by overlaying climate data and soil categories on a spatial map with ArcGIS Pro to identify suitable planting areas.
* Received great recognition from stakeholders, leading to potential opportunities for introducing wheat in the Taiwanese market.

### Tools:
* ArcGIS Pro
