   - What are the key metrics? -> facts 
   -When does the team want to see it?  -> The frequency (daily/weekly/ monthly/ quarterly/ yearly reports? ) 
   - Where does the team want to see it?  -> Desktop, or mobile device 
   - How they want to see it (e.g. by product /by time / by location) -> dimension/attributes
