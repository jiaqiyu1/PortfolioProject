# Customer Retention 

### ðŸ’¡ Business Requirements
A few weeks after presenting your dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom  was impressed by my work and asked if I can put together a dashboard about customer retention.

In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:

* Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we donâ€™t want to lose them
* The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
* Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
* We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
* We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that itâ€™s self-explanatory for our management

### ðŸ’¡ Objectives
To identify reasons for a reduction in revenue by investigating customer churn, determining the reasons behind it, and recommending steps to improve customer retention.

### ðŸ’¡ KPIs used for this analysis
* Customers who left within the last month
* Services: each customer has signed up for: phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.
* Customer account information: how long as a customer(tenure), contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, total charges, and a number of tickets opened in the categories administrative and technical.
* Demographic info about customers â€“ gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents.
