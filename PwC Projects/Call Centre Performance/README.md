## â˜Ž Business Requirements
Create a dashboard in Power BI that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. The Call Centre Manager is looking for an accurate overview of long-term trends in customer and agent behaviour.

After cleaning and modelling the data to a star schema, my solution was to create a dashboard that answered the KPIs,
focusing on the following points:
* Overall customer satisfaction
* Overall calls answered/abandoned
* Calls by time
* Average speed of answer
* Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered
